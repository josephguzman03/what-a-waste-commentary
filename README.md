For our final project, we embarked on an exploration of the world of second-hand clothing and its profound implications in today's environmental landscape. In recent times, the alarming surge in textile waste has emerged as a pivotal threat to our ecosystem, prompting a pressing need  for alternative solutions. Motivated by this urgency, we delved into the realm of sustainable fashion, aiming to discern the efficacy of adopting second-hand apparel as a means to mitigate the environmental repercussions of textile disposal.Recognizing a common trend among younger individuals who choose second-hand clothing or vintage/thrifted itemsto conserve resources, we set out to examine the real impact of this practice.Thus, wesought to unravel the question: Does the act of second-hand clothing acquisition significantly alter the environmental crisis induced by textile waste? Through meticulous research and analysis, we endeavored to shed light on this pertinent issue and offer insights into sustainable consumption practices in the realm of fashion.
