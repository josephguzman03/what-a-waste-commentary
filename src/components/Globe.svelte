    <p> For this section of the website, we endeavor to create a visualization depicting 
      the various types of textile imports from around the globe to the United States. Our 
      intention is to provide context for the situation by elucidating the origins of these
       textiles, thereby facilitating a comprehensive understanding for our audience. Although
        the map is still in development, our objective is to identify the primary sources of 
        textile waste. </p>
