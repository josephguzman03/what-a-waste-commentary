    <h3> animation here</h3>
  
    <p> For this section of the website, we wanted to incorparte some 
        form of animation. We thought that although the data seemed to 
        compel to our argument, having an animation can depict the overall picture of 
        the cause. So our vision, in we hope to complete in the next week, is to 
        have a clothes fall from the sky and have it so it piles up in the end. This can 
        be interprate as a data visual as we envision the cloths to pile like a parabola.   </p>
